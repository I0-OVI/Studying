### Decision tree
> one sentence to conclude: predicting by starting from the root node and following a path of decision rules to the leaf node which provides the final output

Again, I would use a classic example to illustrate how it works.

This is a simple decision tree which predicts the risk of heart disease. If there is a person who is age 31, program will enter the third sub tree and determine if this person is a smoker. If he is a smoker, the model will claim that he may have a high risk of hear disease.
